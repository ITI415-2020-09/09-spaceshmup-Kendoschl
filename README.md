# Space-SHMUP
For Part 1, My spaceship moves faster. The blaster shoots more often and does less damage than the spread weapon. The spread weapon shoots 5 shots, less interavals and
does more damage. 

For Part 2, I have added a new weapon. the lasers shoot a slow firing and moving beam that does damage over time if the emeny stays inside the beam. The beam does not disappear
when it hits an enemy.
